# BankApp
A simple GUI application for a bank account. 
To create a customer account, the user must login as an admin (user & pasword = admin) and create an account with a username and a password (Accounts start with an initial Balance of 100$). 
The customer's credentials will be kept in same directory as the application. 
Customers with an existing account will be able to withdrawal, deposit and make an ePurchase.  
there will be 3 different accounts for the customers, which will depend on the money deposited in their account; Silver ( Balance < 10000), Gold ( 10000 <= Balance <20000), and Platinum( Balance >= 20000)
